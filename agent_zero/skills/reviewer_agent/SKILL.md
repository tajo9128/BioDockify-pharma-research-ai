# ReviewerAgent Skill

This skill provides an automated peer-review layer for research content generated by AI. It prevents hallucinations by ensuring every citation maps to a real academic paper.

## Capabilities

1.  **Citation Extraction**: Automatically finds `[Author, Year]` and `DOI` citations.
2.  **Cross-Database Verification**: Queries Semantic Scholar, CrossRef, and Europe PMC.
3.  **Integrity Scoring**: Generates an overall percentage score for the text's reliability.
4.  **Evidence Mapping**: Finds the closest real paper if a citation is suspicious.

## Usage in Agent Zero

```python
from agent_zero.skills.reviewer_agent import get_reviewer_agent
reviewer = get_reviewer_agent()

# Verify a research summary
report = reviewer.verify_citations("Recent work [Selkoe, 1991] confirms amyloid hypothesis.")
print(f"Integrity Score: {report['integrity_score']}%")
```

## Integration Hooks
- **PhD Stages**: Automatically used during `writing` and `submission` phases.
- **Tools**: Exposed as `verify_citations` tool in the orchestrator.
