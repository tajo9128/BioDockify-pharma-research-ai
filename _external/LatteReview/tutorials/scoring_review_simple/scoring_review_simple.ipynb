    "Here, we will define three reviewer agents. Agents 1 and 2 are scoring reviewers, each designed with a different background and prompted to employ different types of reasoning. They will work in parallel, reviewing every input title and abstract to determine whether the article discusses large language model-based AI agents applied to medical imaging data. Agent 3, on the other hand, is another scoring reviewer prompted to act as a more senior reviewer. Its role is to resolve conflicts by reviewing articles where Agents 1 and 2 have provided differing scores, deciding whether to include or exclude those articles. In other words, Agent 3 is responsible for resolving disagreements between Agents 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to note that different models are used for these agents. Agents 1 and 2, which need to review many articles, are based on smaller and more cost-efficient models: Gemini 1.1 Flash and GPT-4.0 Mini, respectively. Agent 3, tasked with the more complex job of conflict resolution, uses GPT-4.0, a more expensive model. However, since Agent 3 only reviews a small subset of articles where discrepancies occur, its usage is limited. If Agents 1 and 2 agree on all articles, Agent 3 may not be called upon to perform any tasks at all."

      "        Title: Fusing an agent-based model of mosquito population dynamics with a statistical reconstruction of spatio-temporal abundance patterns\n",
      "        Abstract: The mosquito Aedes aegypti is the vector of a number of medically-important viruses, including dengue virus, yellow virus, chikungunya virus, and Zika virus, and as such vector control is a key approach to managing the diseases they cause. Understanding the impact of vector control on these diseases is aided by first understanding its impact on Ae. aegypti population dynamics. A number of detail-rich models have been developed to couple the dynamics of the immature and adult stages of Ae. aegypti. The numerous assumptions of these models enable them to realistically characterize impacts of mosquito control, but they also constrain the ability of such models to reproduce empirical patterns that do not conform to the models’ behavior. In contrast, statistical models afford sufficient flexibility to extract nuanced signals from noisy data, yet they have limited ability to make predictions about impacts of mosquito control on disease caused by pathogens that the mosquitoes transmit without extensive data on mosquitoes and disease. Here, we demonstrate how the differing strengths of mechanistic realism and statistical flexibility can be fused into a single model. Our analysis utilizes data from 176,352 household-level Ae. aegypti aspirator collections conducted during 1999-2011 in Iquitos, Peru. The key step in our approach is to calibrate a single parameter of the model to spatio-temporal abundance patterns predicted by a generalized additive model (GAM). In effect, this calibrated parameter absorbs residual variation in the abundance time-series not captured by other features of the mechanistic model. We then used this calibrated parameter and the literature-derived parameters in the agent-based model to explore Ae. aegypti population dynamics and the impact of insecticide spraying to kill adult mosquitoes. The baseline abundance predicted by the agent-based model closely matched that predicted by the GAM. Following spraying, the agent-based model predicted that mosquito abundance rebounds within about two months, commensurate with recent experimental data from Iquitos. Our approach was able to accurately reproduce abundance patterns in Iquitos and produce a realistic response to adulticide spraying, while retaining sufficient flexibility to be applied across a range of settings.\n",

      "        Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been increasingly applied in monitoring applications because of its ability to learn from previous experiences and can make adaptive decisions. However, existing machine learning-based health monitoring applications are mostly supervised learning algorithms, trained on labels and they cannot make adaptive decisions in an uncertain complex environment. This study proposes a novel and generic system, predictive deep reinforcement learning (PDRL) with multiple RL agents in a time series forecasting environment. The proposed generic framework accommodates virtual Deep Q Network (DQN) agents to monitor predicted future states of a complex environment with a well-defined reward policy so that the agent learns existing knowledge while maximizing their rewards. In the evaluation process of the proposed framework, three DRL agents were deployed to monitor a subject’s future heart rate, respiration, and temperature predicted using a BiLSTM model. With each iteration, the three agents were able to learn the associated patterns and their cumulative rewards gradually increased. It outperformed the baseline models for all three monitoring agents. The proposed PDRL framework is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in the time series forecasting process. The proposed DRL agents and deep learning model in the PDRL framework are customized to implement the transfer learning in other forecasting applications like traffic and weather and monitor their states. The PDRL framework is able to learn the future states of the traffic and weather forecasting and the cumulative rewards are gradually increasing over each episode.\n",

      "        Abstract: In this paper we present AceMod, an agent-based modelling framework for studying inuenza epidemics in Australia. The simulator is designed to analyse the spatiotemporal spread of contagion and inuenza spatial synchrony across the nation. The individual-based epidemiological model accounts for mobility (worker and student commuting) patterns and human interactions derived from the 2006 Australian census and other national data sources. The high-precision simulation comprises 19.8 million stochastically generated software agents and traces the dynamics of inuenza viral infection and transmission at several scales. Using this approach, we are able to synthesise epidemics in Australia with varying outbreak locations and severity. For each scenario, we investigate the spatiotemporal profiles of these epidemics, both qualitatively and quantitatively, via incidence curves, prevalence choropleths, and epidemic synchrony. This analysis exemplifies the nature of inuenza pandemics within Australia and facilitates future planning of effective intervention, mitigation and crisis management strategies.\n",

      "        Abstract: Mathematical and simulation models are often used to predict the spread of a disease and estimate the impact of public health interventions, and many such models have been developed and used during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper describes a study that systematically compared models for a university community, which has a much smaller but more connected population than a state or nation. We developed a stochastic agent-based model, a deterministic compartment model, and a model based on ordinary differential equations. All three models represented the disease progression with the same susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model. We created a baseline scenario for a population of 14,000 students and faculty and eleven other scenarios for combinations of interventions such as regular testing, contact tracing, quarantine, isolation, moving courses online, mask wearing, improving ventilation, and vaccination. Where possible, our study used parameter values from other epidemiological studies and incorporated data about COVID-19 testing in College Park, Maryland, but the study was designed to compare modeling approaches to each other using a synthetic population, so comparisons with data about actual cases were not relevant. For each scenario we used the models to estimate the number of persons who become infected over a period of 119 days (17 weeks in a semester). We evaluated the models by comparing their predictions and evaluating their parsimony and computational effort. The agent-based model (ABM) and the deterministic compartment model (DCM) had similar results with cyclic flow of persons to and from quarantine, but the model based on ordinary differential equations failed to capture these dynamics. The ABM’s computation time was much greater than the other two models’ computation time. The DCM captured some of the dynamics that were present in the ABM’s predictions and, like those from the ABM, clearly showed the importance of testing and moving classes on-line.\n",

      "        Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used as aerial base stations to provide ad hoc communications infrastructure. Building upon prior research efforts which consider either static nodes, 2D trajectories or single UAV systems, this paper focuses on the use of multiple UAVs for providing wireless communication to mobile users in the absence of terrestrial communications infrastructure. In particular, we jointly optimize UAV 3D trajectory and NOMA power allocation to maximize system throughput. Firstly, a weighted K-means-based clustering algorithm establishes UAV-user associations at regular intervals. The efficacy of training a novel Shared Deep Q-Network (SDQN) with action masking is then explored. Unlike training each UAV separately using DQN, the SDQN reduces training time by using the experiences of multiple UAVs instead of a single agent. We also show that SDQN can be used to train a multi-agent system with differing action spaces. Simulation results confirm that: 1) training a shared DQN outperforms a conventional DQN in terms of maximum system throughput (+20%) and training time (-10%); 2) it can converge for agents with different action spaces, yielding a 9% increase in throughput compared to mutual learning algorithms; and 3) combining NOMA with an SDQN architecture enables the network to achieve a better sum rate compared with existing baseline schemes.\n",

      "        Abstract: Human beings live in a networked world in which information spreads very fast thanks to the advances in technology. In the decision processes or opinion formation there are different ideas of what is collectively good but they tend to go against the self interest of a large amount of agents. Here we proposed a simple model who try to mimic, in some extent, this class of problems. We look at interacting agents connected in networks to analyze the multi-agent decision stochastic process. Each individual decision may be influenced by others decisions. We consider a first neighbor interaction where agents are spread through a uni-dimensional network. Some agents are also connected to a hub, or master node, who has preferential values (or orientation). The role of master node is to persuade some individuals to follow a specific orientation, subject to a probability of successful persuasion. The connections between master node and the network society are quenched in disorder. Despite its simplicity, we found a phase transition from disorder to order for three different control parameters. We also discuss how this model may be useful as a framework to study the spread of morality, innovation, opinion formation and consensus. Is important to recall the route from disorder to order in social systems still a great challenge. We hope to contribute with a novel approach to model a this issues.\n",

      "        Abstract: Collective motion of cells is common in many physiological processes, including tissue development, repair, and tumor formation. Recent experiments have shown that certain malignant cancer cells form clusters in a chemoattractant gradient, which display three different phases of motion: translational, rotational, and random. Intriguingly, all three phases are observed simultaneously, with clusters spontaneously switching between these modes of motion. The origin of this behavior is not understood at present, especially the robust appearance of cluster rotations. Guided by experiments on the motion of two-dimensional clusters in-vitro, we developed an agent based model in which the cells form a cohesive cluster due to attractive and alignment interactions but with potentially different behaviors based on their local environment. We find that when cells at the cluster rim are more motile, all three phases of motion coexist, in excellent agreement with the observations. Using the model we can identify that the transitions between different phases are driven by a competition between an ordered rim and a disordered core accompanied by the creation and annihilation of topological defects in the velocity field. The model makes definite predictions regarding the dependence of the motility phase of the cluster on its size and external chemical gradient, which agree with our experimental data. Our results suggest that heterogeneous behavior of individuals, based on local environment, can lead to novel, experimentally observed phases of collective motion.\n",

These effects hold even at the lower filtering rates of homemade masks. To validate these theoretical models, we compare their predictions against a new empirical data set we have collected that includes whether regions have universal masking cultures or policies, their daily case growth rates, and their percentage reduction from peak daily case growth rates. Results show a near perfect correlation between early universal masking and successful suppression of daily case growth rates and/or reduction from peak daily case growth rates, as predicted by our theoretical simulations. Taken in tandem, our theoretical models and empirical results argue for urgent implementation of universal masking in regions that have not yet adopted it as policy or.\n",

      "        Abstract: Public policies that supply public goods, especially those involve collaboration by limiting individual liberty, always give rise to controversies over governance legitimacy. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) methods are appropriate for supporting the legitimacy of the public policies that supply public goods at the cost of individual interests. Among these policies, the inter-regional collaborative pandemic control is a prominent example, which has become much more important for an increasingly inter-connected world facing a global pandemic like COVID-19. Different patterns of collaborative strategies have been observed among different systems of regions, yet it lacks an analytical process to reason for the legitimacy of those strategies. In this paper, we use the inter-regional collaboration for pandemic control as an example to demonstrate the necessity of MARL in reasoning, and thereby legitimizing policies enforcing such inter-regional collaboration. Experimental results in an exemplary environment show that our MARL approach is able to demonstrate the effectiveness and necessity of restrictions on individual liberty for collaborative supply of public goods. Different optimal policies are learned by our MARL agents under different collaboration levels, which change in an interpretable pattern of collaboration that helps to balance the losses suffered by regions of different types, and consequently promotes the overall welfare. Meanwhile, policies learned with higher collaboration levels yield higher global rewards, which illustrates the benefit of, and thus provides a novel justification for the legitimacy of, promoting inter-regional collaboration. Therefore, our method shows the capability of MARL in computationally modeling and supporting the theory of calculus of consent, developed by Nobel Prize winner J. M. Buchanan.\n",

This review visits many different families of models: deterministic compartmental models based on differential equations, stochastic processes, stochastic differential equations, Gaussian process regression, Bayesian regression, agent-based models, and integro-differential models. In this regard, this is one of the most comprehensive reviews. Additionally, we show these families, not as unrelated entities, but following a common thread in which the problems or assumptions of a model are solved or generalized by another model. In this way, we can understand their relationships, assumptions, simplifications, and, ultimately, limitations. Prompted by the current Covid19 pandemic, we have a special focus on spread forecasting. We illustrate the difficulties encountered to do realistic predictions. In general, they are only approximations to a reality whose biological and societal complexity is much larger. Particularly troublesome are the large underlying variability, the problem’s time-varying nature, and the difficulty to estimate the required parameters for a faithful model. This complexity makes that predictions based on simple models are not very useful in the long term. Additionally, we will also see that these models have a multiplicative nature implying that small errors in the system parameters cause a huge uncertainty in the prediction. Stochastic or agent-based models can overcome some of the modeling problems of systems based on differential or stochastic equations. The main difficulty in using these models is that they are as accurate and realistic as the data available to estimate their detailed parametrization, and very often this detailed data is not at the modeller’s disposal. Although the predictive power of mathematical models to forecast the evolution of a contagious disease is very limited, these models are still very useful to plan interventions as they can calculate their impact if all other parameters stay fixed. They are also very useful to understand the properties of disease propagation in complex systems.\n",

      "        Abstract: We introduce Brain-Artificial Intelligence Interfaces (BAIs) as a new class of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). Unlike conventional BCIs, which rely on intact cognitive capabilities, BAIs leverage the power of artificial intelligence to replace parts of the neuro-cognitive processing pipeline. BAIs allow users to accomplish complex tasks by providing high-level intentions, while a pre-trained AI agent determines low-level details. This approach enlarges the target audience of BCIs to individuals with cognitive impairments, a population often excluded from the benefits of conventional BCIs. We present the general concept of BAIs and illustrate the potential of this new approach with a Conversational BAI based on EEG. In particular, we show in an experiment with simulated phone conversations that the Conversational BAI enables complex communication without the need to generate language. Our work thus demonstrates, for the first time, the ability of a speech neuroprosthesis to enable fluent communication in realistic scenarios with non-invasive technologies.\n",

      "        Abstract: Over the recent years, Reinforcement Learning combined with Deep Learning techniques has successfully proven to solve complex problems in various domains, including robotics, self-driving cars, and finance. In this paper, we are introducing Reinforcement Learning (RL) to label placement, a complex task in data visualization that seeks optimal positioning for labels to avoid overlap and ensure legibility. Our novel point-feature label placement method utilizes Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning to learn the label placement strategy, the first machine-learning-driven labeling method, in contrast to the existing hand-crafted algorithms designed by human experts. To facilitate RL learning, we developed an environment where an agent acts as a proxy for a label, a short textual annotation that augments visualization. Our results show that the strategy trained by our method significantly outperforms the random strategy of an untrained agent and the compared methods designed by human experts in terms of completeness (i.e., the number of placed labels). The trade-off is increased computation time, making the proposed method slower than the compared methods. Nevertheless, our method is ideal for scenarios where the labeling can be computed in advance, and completeness is essential, such as cartographic maps, technical drawings, and medical atlases. Additionally, we conducted a user study to assess the perceived performance. The outcomes revealed that the participants considered the proposed method to be significantly better than the other examined methods. This indicates that the improved completeness is not just reflected in the quantitative metrics but also in the subjective evaluation by the participants.\n",

      "        Abstract: For autonomous agents to successfully operate in the real world, anticipation of future events and states of their environment is a key competence. This problem can be formalized as a sequence prediction problem, where a number of observations are used to predict the sequence into the future. However, real-world scenarios demand a model of uncertainty of such predictions, as future states become increasingly uncertain and multi-modal – in particular on long time horizons. This makes modelling and learning challenging. We cast state of the art semantic segmentation and future prediction models based on deep learning into a Bayesian formulation that in turn allows for a full Bayesian treatment of the prediction problem. We present a new sampling scheme for this model that draws from the success of variational autoencoders by incorporating a recognition network. In the experiments we show that our model outperforms prior work in accuracy of the predicted segmentation and provides calibrated probabilities that also better capture the multi-modal aspects of possible future states of street scenes.\n",

      "        Abstract: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy shows promise for treating liquid cancers and increasingly for solid tumors as well. While potential design strategies exist to address translational challenges, including the lack of unique tumor antigens and the presence of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, testing all possible design choices in vitro and in vivo is prohibitively expensive, time consuming, and laborious. To address this gap, we extended the modeling framework ARCADE (Agent-based Representation of Cells And Dynamic Environments) to include CAR T-cell agents (CAR T-cell ARCADE, or CARCADE). We conducted in silico experiments to investigate how clinically relevant design choices and inherent tumor features-CAR T-cell dose, CD4+:CD8+ CAR T-cell ratio, CAR-antigen affinity, cancer and healthy cell antigen expression-individually and collectively impact treatment outcomes. Our analysis revealed that tuning CAR affinity modulates IL-2 production by balancing CAR T-cell proliferation and effector function. It also identified a novel multi-feature tuned treatment strategy for balancing selectivity and efficacy and provided insights into how spatial effects can impact relative treatment performance in different contexts. CARCADE facilitates deeper biological understanding of treatment design and could ultimately enable identification of promising treatment strategies to accelerate solid tumor CAR T-cell design-build-test cycles.\n",

We propose a novel communicative multi-agent reinforcement learning (C-MARL) system to automatically detect landmarks in 3D medical scans.

The proposed approach is evaluated on two brain imaging datasets from adult magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fetal ultrasound scans. Our experiments show that involving multiple cooperating agents by learning their communication with each other outperforms previous approaches using single agents.\n",

      "        Abstract: This paper presents our team’s participation in the MEDIQA-ClinicalNLP 2024 shared task B. We present a novel approach to diagnosing clinical dermatology cases by integrating large multimodal models, specifically leveraging the capabilities of GPT-4V under a retriever and a re-ranker framework. Our investigation reveals that GPT-4V, when used as a retrieval agent, can accurately retrieve the correct skin condition 85% of the time using dermatological images and brief patient histories. Additionally, we empirically show that Naive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) works well for retrieval while Medical Guidelines Grounded CoT is required for accurate dermatological diagnosis. Further, we introduce a Multi-Agent Conversation (MAC) framework and show it’s superior performance and potential over the best CoT strategy. The experiments suggest that using naive CoT for retrieval and multi-agent conversation for critique-based diagnosis, GPT-4V can lead to an early and accurate diagnosis of dermatological conditions. The implications of this work extend to improving diagnostic workflows, supporting dermatological education, and enhancing patient care by providing a scalable, accessible, and accurate diagnostic tool.\n",

      "        Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with retrieval augmented-generation (RAG) have been the optimal choice for scalable generative AI solutions in the recent past. Although RAG implemented with AI agents (agentic-RAG) has been recently popularized, its suffers from unstable cost and unreliable performances for Enterprise-level data-practices. Most existing use-cases that incorporate RAG with LLMs have been either generic or extremely domain specific, thereby questioning the scalability and generalizability of RAG-LLM approaches. In this work, we propose a unique LLM-based system where multiple LLMs can be invoked to enable data authentication, userquery routing, data-retrieval and custom prompting for questionanswering capabilities from Enterprise-data tables. The source tables here are highly fluctuating and large in size and the proposed framework enables structured responses in under 10 seconds per query. Additionally, we propose a five metric scoring module that detects and reports hallucinations in the LLM responses. Our proposed system and scoring metrics achieve > 90% confidence scores across hundreds of user queries in the sustainability, financial health and social media domains. Extensions to the proposed extreme RAG architectures can enable heterogeneous source querying using LLMs.\n",
