These reviewers will analyze the data to determine the clinical application of each article and whether or not the articles involve the application of AI to CT data. Creating a custom reviewer agent class is straightforward—you just need to design a prompt and build your class by inheriting from the basic reviewer class. By doing so, you gain access to all the baseline features, attributes, and methods of the basic reviewer class. For example, as shown below, when defining a senior reviewer, you can provide additional context to enable the senior reviewer to consider the junior reviewer’s assessment of the article and understand why their assistance was requested."
