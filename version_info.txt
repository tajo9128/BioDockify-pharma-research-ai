[RELEASE NOTES]
Version: 2.19.0
Date: 2026-02-01

Features:
- **Optional Verification**: Users can now skip the initial email verification setup and explore the application in "Limited Mode".
- **Feature Gating**: Premium features (Research Workstation, Academic Suite, Deep Research, OmniTools) are now protected and require a verified account.
- **Improved UX**: New "Locked" visual states for restricted modules, preserving the application layout while clearly indicating requirements.
- **Security**: Added robust internal access guards to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive components.

Fixes:
- Fixed an issue where the Deep Research module would fail due to an API response type mismatch.
- Corrected database target tables for license verification (Supabase 'profiles').
- Resolved startup connectivity check issues.
