## 🏗️ The Four-Pillar Architecture

BioDockify is built on four core specialized engines that interact to provide research autonomy and privacy:

1.  **🧠 Agent Zero (The Reasoner)**: The central intelligence engine. Handles goal decomposition, research planning, and complex multi-step orchestration.
2.  **🤖 NanoBot (The Executor)**: The action layer. Manages tool execution, stealth browsing, and biological hardware (SiLA 2) interaction.
3.  **📚 SurfSense (The Knowledge Base)**: The deep research layer. Autonomously crawls, parses (GROBID), and indexes scientific literature.
4.  **🛡️ LM Studio (The Local Brain)**: The privacy layer. Enables **100% offline, zero-leakage reasoning** using locally-hosted models for sensitive data.

## 🌟 The Elite Skill Suite

Agent Zero is equipped with specialized "Skills" tailored for elite academic and clinical research:

*   **🎓 Achademio**: A specialized pharmaceutical research assistant that understands PhD-level scientific terminology and protocols.
*   **🏎️ Deep Drive**: An extreme research engine for high-depth investigation into niche pharmaceutical topics.
*   **🤝 Scholar Copilot**: Real-time collaborative research assistant for managing literature and hypothesis generation.
*   **🔍 Reviewer Agent**: Simulates a rigorous peer-review process to critique manuscripts, theses, and experimental designs.

---

## 🔬 Deep Pharma & Clinical Suite

Advanced modules for the frontlines of drug development and clinical validation:

*   **📊 Clinical Statistics (3-Tier)**: Advanced statistical engine supporting **Kaplan-Meier & Cox Regression (Survival Analysis)**, ANOVA, and Power Analysis.
*   **🧪 Molecular Vision**: Image-to-SMILES engine that converts chemical structure photos into machine-readable data.
*   **🔗 Lab Automation**: Generates **SiLA 2 compliant XML** protocols for liquid-handling robots (Tecan/Hamilton).
*   **💡 Scientific Method**: AI-assisted **Hypothesis Engine** for experimental design and mechanism-of-action discovery.

---

## 🎓 The Publication Engine

Automate everything from thesis drafting to journal submission:

*   **📗 Pharma-Thesis Factory**: Templates for **Pharmacology, Pharmaceutics, Chemistry, and Pharm.D** (Optimized for B.Pharm to PhD).
*   **📝 Systematic Review (LatteReview)**: Automated screening, scoring, and data abstraction for SLRs and scoping reviews.
*   **�️ Journal Intelligence**: AI-powered discovery of high-impact journals with impact factor analysis and submission verifiers.
*   **📽️ Multimedia Studio**: Auto-generate **Academic PowerPoint Slides**, Video presentation scripts, and **AI Podcasts**.

---

## 🕸️ The Knowledge Hub

Turn fragmented data into structured pharmaceutical intelligence:

*   **🕸️ Graph Builder**: Visualizes complex drug-disease-gene connections using **Neo4j Knowledge Graphs**.
*   **🧬 Bio-NER Engine**: Entity extraction specialized for proteins, genes, and drugs, integrated with global databases.
*   **📥 PDF Processor**: High-fidelity parsing of academic papers using **GROBID** to extract tables and citations.

---

## 🤖 Autonomic Resilience & Exploration

The system is designed to "Self-Heal" and bypass research roadblocks:

*   **🩹 Self-Healing**: Automated recovery from tool failures via `RepairableException` analysis and auto-fix generation.
*   **🕵️ Stealth Research**: Playwright-based "human-like" engine for bypassing bot detection on protected academic portals.
*   **🦁 Omni-Search**: Integrated **Brave Search** for real-time news and **Omni-Tools** for secure local PDF/Image processing.

---

## 🛡️ Enterprise Governance & Security

Ensuring your research meets the highest standards of integrity and compliance:

*   **📜 Security Audit**: Full GxP-ready audit logging and license validation for institutional research.
*   **⚖️ Academic Compliance**: Automated checks for plagiarism, citation integrity, and ethical standard alignment.
*   **🛡️ Multi-Channel Delivery**: Secure delivery of findings via **Email, Telegram, Discord, and WhatsApp**.
